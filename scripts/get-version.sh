# This script calculates the current version based on the current branch and on the existing tags:
# - For tags (in the form v1.0.2) the version returned is always a stable one; in the previous example it would return 1.0.2.
# - For release branches (in the form release/3.1) it will return a SNAPSHOT version with the patch number increased by 1. The current patch number
#   is extracted from the highest tag with the same major.minor version as the release branch. The release branches will be updated only to backport
#   small functionalities or hotfixes, so they will just increase the patch number. In this example it could return 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT.bb67482.381-test.
# - For all other branches, it will find the highest tag available and return a SNAPSHOT version with patch 0 and the minor increased by 1.
#   So in case the highest tag is 1.2.4 it would return 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.bb67482.381-test.
# Since artifacts are built from the master branch, release branches, and tags, we should not worry about feature/hotfix branches, but it any case
# they will behave exactly like the master branch.
